**👋 Hi, I’m Amit Kumar (@iim-amit)**

👀 **About Me**

I’m a passionate coder with a strong focus on C++ and frontend technologies. My journey in programming has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex algorithms and build intuitive user interfaces. I thrive on solving challenging problems and developing software solutions that make a difference.


🌱 **Current Learning**

I’m currently deepening my knowledge in advanced C++ programming, exploring topics like memory management, concurrency, and high-performance computing. On the frontend side, I’m delving into modern frameworks such as React and Vue.js to create responsive and dynamic web applications. My goal is to bridge the gap between efficient backend processing and seamless user experiences.


💞️ **Collaboration & Open Source**

I am actively involved in open-source projects through the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, where I contribute to community-driven projects and collaborate with developers worldwide. I’m particularly interested in working on projects that combine robust C++ backend solutions with engaging frontend interfaces. If you have ideas for full-stack applications, need help with C++ optimization, or want to collaborate on open-source initiatives, feel free to reach out!
